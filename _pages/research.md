## 1. Explicit formulas for mixed Hodge polynomials of character varieties of nilpotent groups
### With <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/singh-rahul/home" target="_blank">Rahul Singh</a>, submitted. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10008" target="_blank">ArXiv: 2410.10008</a>.
Let $\text{Hom}^0(\Gamma,G)$ be the path-connected component of the identity representation of the variety of representations of a finitely generated nilpotent group $\Gamma$ into a connected reductive complex affine algebraic group $G$. With the formulas given by Florentino, Lawton and Silva, we provide explicit partition type formulas for the mixed Hodge polynomials of character varieties when $G=Sp_{2n}$ and $G=SO_{n}$.
## 2. Motivic classes of stacks in finite characteristic and applications to stacks of Higgs bundles
### <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09861" target="_blank">ArXiv: 2509.09861</a>.
We define a ring of motivic classes of stacks suitable for symmetric powers in finite characteristic. Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve over a field of arbitrary characteristic. We calculate the motivic classes of the moduli stacks of semistable Higgs bundles on $X$. This recovers results of Fedorov, A. Soibelman and Y. Soibelman in characteristic zero, as well as those of Mozgovoy and Schiffmann for finite fields. We also obtain a simpler formula for the motivic classes of Higgs bundles in the universal $\lambda$-ring quotient using Mellit's results.

<!-- ### Future Work

Some topics that I hope to explore in the future include the role of corporate disclosures in managing climate and sustainability efforts as well as the use of accounting information by less traditional stakeholders such as consumers and employees. I am very interested in the risks posed by climate change as well as the movement towards sustainability and inclusion. Given the increasing supply and access of accounting information as well as the rapidly evolving regulatory and disclosure landscape with respect to climate goals, I feel that research on these topics is compelling and has the potential to answer questions of economic significance. -->
