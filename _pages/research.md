## 1. Explicit formulas for mixed Hodge polynomials of character varieties of nilpotent groups 
### With <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/singh-rahul/home" target="_blank">Rahul Singh</a>, submitted. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10008" target="_blank">arXiv: 2410.10008</a>.
Let $\text{Hom}^0(\Gamma,G)$ be the path-connected component of the identity representation of the variety of representations of a finitely generated nilpotent group $\Gamma$ into a connected reductive complex affine algebraic group $G$. With the formulas given by Florentino, Lawton and Silva, we provide explicit partition type formulas for the mixed Hodge polynomials of character varieties when $G=Sp_{2n}$ and $G=SO_{n}$.
## 2. Motivic classes of stacks in finite characteristic and applications to stacks of Higgs bundles and bundles with connections
### In Preparation. <a href="/files/Poster_AGNES.pdf" target="_blank">Poster</a>/<a href="/files/Motivic classes_Binghamton talk.pdf" target="_blank">Slides</a> 
Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve over a field of finite characteristic. We calculate the motivic classes of the moduli stack of semistable Higgs bundles and bundles with connections on $X$. We follow the strategy of Fedorov and Soibelmans for motivic classes in characteristic zero. The main new ingredient is a version of Hua's formula relating the motivic classes of bundles with endomorphisms to the motivic classes of geometrically indecomposable bundles with endomorphisms.

<!-- ### Future Work

Some topics that I hope to explore in the future include the role of corporate disclosures in managing climate and sustainability efforts as well as the use of accounting information by less traditional stakeholders such as consumers and employees. I am very interested in the risks posed by climate change as well as the movement towards sustainability and inclusion. Given the increasing supply and access of accounting information as well as the rapidly evolving regulatory and disclosure landscape with respect to climate goals, I feel that research on these topics is compelling and has the potential to answer questions of economic significance. -->
