- I will be on the job market this fall.

- I'm a sixth-year math PhD student at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of <a href="https://www.mathematics.pitt.edu/people/roman-fedorov"> Prof. Roman Fedorov</a>. Before that, I received my master's degree from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and bachelor's degree from Nankai University.

- My research focuses on algebraic geometry and representation theory. More specifically, I am interested in moduli stacks of Higgs bundles and bundles with connections, character varieties, and moduli spaces of quiver representations.

### Upcoming Travel:

1. <a href="https://geometryvcu.github.io/rgm2025/" target="_blank">Richmond Geometry Meeting</a>, September 19-21, 2025.
   
TRIVIA. There are at least two more Ruoxis working in algebraic geometry:    
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/liruoxi"> Ruoxi Li at UIUC</a>  
<a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/people/ruoxi-li"> Ruoxi Li at UC Berkeley</a>
